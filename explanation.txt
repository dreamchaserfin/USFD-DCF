### Issue 1

Row 120 `Capital Expenditures` should be directly linked to row 143, rather than the change from period to period in row 143.
Remember `Capital Expenditures` are a cash flow not a balance sheet item.


### Issue 2

Row 108 `Depreciaton and Amortization` only contains the `Depreciation` and not `Amortization`
Solution:
Update this row to include `Amortization`


### Issue 3

Row 92 `Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss` is linked to `Net Profit` in the same way that `Retained Earnings` is.
This meant sthat the P&L is double counting `Net profit` and its effect on `Equity`.

Solution:
Keep `Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss` constant at $(54)'000. 
Changes in this line item relate to items that aren't shown in the P&L above, like losses and gains in some financial instruments.
